# Flex Chess

## Description

A web application for creating a unique chess experience. From different boards to having a full cheboard of only queens.

## Usage

In this web app you can use our home page as a directory for what you would like to do. We recommend starting with creating a new game which will direct you to our editor. In the editor you can use different selectors and options to place the tiles and pieces that you would like in any configuration you would like. When you are happy with what you have made you can save it and then use the board you created to play the game out. So far this can only be done locally.
