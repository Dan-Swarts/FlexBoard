# Flex Chess

## Description

A web application for creating a unique chess experience, from different boards to a whole chessboard of only queens.

## Usage

In this web app, you can use our home page as a directory for what you want to do. We recommend that you create a new board. You will be directed to the board editor when you make a new board. In the editor, you can use different selectors and options to place the tiles and pieces you would like in any configuration. When you are happy with what you have made, you can save it and then use the board you created to play the game. So far, this can only be done locally.
